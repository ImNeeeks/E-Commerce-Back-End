## Description
            
This project is an E-commerce Back-End application that utilizes a working Express.js API and configures it to use [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) to interact with a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database.

I built this application as a way to manage data in a complex database spread throughout several relational tables. By using this application within the context of a sample "E-commerce store", we can use the API client [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) to either view, add, update or delete data to reflect the store's stock of items. 

### Video walkthrough showcasing application functionality:

To view a video walkthrough of how to initialise the database, seed the data and access the data via its API routes using Insomnia, watch [a video demonstration here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D7nRzpqfr_UDCUnRjjz2lHXoTKn9T6tn/view?usp=sharing).

## Installation

To install this application, you'll need to clone the repository to your local machine. [Refer to this guide from GitHub if you need help.](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository/)

Once cloned, you will need to navigate to the project's folder in your terminal and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies: `npm install`.

Next, you will need PostgreSQL installed on your computer to initialise the database. [Visit PostgreSQL's website for links to download and installation instructions.](https://www.postgresql.org/)

Lastly, you'll also need to install the API client Insomnia, which you can do by [visiting their website here](https://insomnia.rest/). 
            
## Usage

Once all of the steps in [Installation](#installation) have been completed, you will first need to initialize the 'ecommerce_db' database and seed data into it. To do so, enter the following commands once navigated to the project folder in your terminal:

1. `psql -U postgres` - This will start PostgreSQL. Enter your password if you set one up. 
2. `\i db/schema.sql` - To set up the 'employee_db' database. 
3. Close out of postgres by entering `Control + d`.

Next, seed the data by entering the following once navigated to the project folder in your terminal:

4. `node seeds/index.js`

Then, you can run the server locally by entering the following:

5. `node server.js`.

6. If everything was installed and run correctly, you should be able to test the API routes using Insomnia now. Check my [walkthrough video here to see how you can view, add, update or delete data using these routes.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D7nRzpqfr_UDCUnRjjz2lHXoTKn9T6tn/view?usp=sharing)
